Overlog will be a website designed to manage personal media backlog and reviews of various media types. 

Since this is my first Web Development project, it is a lot of new stuff to learn but all these new things are filling me with passion. 

I am currently working on basic navigation and API implementation, next steps will be
- saving data with cookies (temporary solution)
- CSS visuals
- backend code with a database to store userdata

APIs i am using currently are TMDB for Movies and RAWG for Videogames
